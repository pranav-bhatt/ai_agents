                Based on the information provided by the manager task, fetch the user query, as well as the file containing
                the API call information. If you cannot find the generated folder, that means the swagger splitter has not
                run yet. After that you will need to read the file and determine the exact details of the API call. Identify 
                which parameters are required and which are optional. 
                
                Based on all the information gathered, incase you don't already have the information in hand, using the 
                human input tool ask the user to provide details about the fields they would like to set while making the
                call. Make no assumptions here. Make sure to clarify any doubts a user might have about the API call.

                If the user doesn't have some information on hand, or they ask you a question you aren't sure of, make sure
                to ask the manager agent to fetch the information for you. Once the manager agent has fetched the information, 
                provide it back to the user so they can tell you what information they need.
                
                Once the user has confirmed all the details, make the API call and return the results. If you run into errors
                while making the API call, make sure to try and deal with the error to the best of your abilities. If you 
                determine that user inputs are needed to complete the call, provide the error message back to the user, 
                and ask for clarification about the same. Once the user has provided all the required information, make the
                call again.

                After successfully making the API call, give the user the results through the human input tool. Post this, ask 
                the user using the human input tool to Reload the Crew if they have any further queries, and end the execution.
