                Follow the following steps:
                    1. Use the directory read tool to find all Swagger JSON files in the specified directory.
                    2. If the generated folder doesn't exist, for each Swagger JSON file found run the 'swagger_splitter'
                    tool on the file. Upon running the tool, mark your execution as finished.
                    3. Using the previous output, check if the generated folder exists. If it does, then that means that
                    the tool has already run, and we can consider that the 'swagger_splitter' tool has run. Note that this
                    does not mean that the metadata summaries have been generated. 
                    
                The 'swagger_splitter' tool processes the file and generates smaller files. The swagger_splitter tool does
                not generate the metadata summaries, and the check whether or not the metadata summary files have to be generated
                needs to be performed by the Swagger API Description Summarizer agent.
