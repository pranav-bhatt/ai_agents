                Complete the following steps to make the API call, using the context obtained from the manager_task:
                1. Read the swagger metadata file and identify the API call that the user has asked for. To construct the 
                full path of the API call file, you will need to combine the information obtained from the manager task, 
                as well as the path of the generated folder '{configuration.generated_folder_path}'.
                2. Identify the parameters that are required and optional.
                4. If you don't already have the information, ask the user to provide the information about the parameters.
                Make sure to explicitly specify which parameters are the required and which are optional and also ensure
                to explain each parameter in a well formatted, yet succinct manner. If the user doesn't specify required
                parameters, prompt them gently again. If they leave out optional parameters, proceed without setting them.
                3. If the user asks for information that you don't have, ask your boss, the API selector, to make another 
                API call to help get the information. Once the information is fetched, provide it back to the user in a 
                well formatted manner.
                5. Once the user has provided the necessary information, we need to call the 'api_caller' tool. 
                The api_caller tool , 
                and the value is the value of the parameter. Once you pass the parameters, the tool has logic that will
                parse it and perform the API call on your behalf. Make sure to refer to the description of the 'api_caller'
                tool while passing parameters. Once you have constructed the final list of parameters, show it to the
                user and get a confirmation that they are fine with the payload.
                6. Make the API call by triggering the API call tool. If the API call returns an error, try to deal with 
                the error yourself. If you determine that the error needs user intervention / clarification from the user,
                go ahead and ask the user the necessary query. Once you have the details, go ahead and try to make the API
                call again. The 'api_caller' tool supports **kwargs which you can use to send any extra parameters such as
                "API_BEARER_TOKEN" and "API_ENDPOINT" in case the API call returned an error due to incorrect API endpoint 
                or Bearer token being used, and the user has provided you with rectified values when you reported the error.
                7. Once a satisfactory output has been obtained, return the outcome of the api call.
                8. Once the outcome is returned, using the 'get_human_input' tool, inform the user with the below prompt:
                'Please Reload the Crew if you have any other queries to be answered', and finish the execution.
